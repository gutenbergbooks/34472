<h2>Origin and Early History<br>
Of the Fashion Plate</h2>

<p><i>A fashion plate is a costume portrait indicating a suitable style
of clothing that can be made or secured. Fashion illustration began in
the late 15th and early 16th centuries with portrait pictures that made
a person’s identity known not by his individual features but rather by
his dress.</i></p>

<p><i>This paper, based on a lecture given in the fall of 1963 at the
Metropolitan Museum, New York, traces the history of the fashion plate
from its origins to its full development in the 19th century. With the
improvements in transportation and communication, increased attention
came to be paid to foreign fashions, accessories, and even to
hairstyles. As the reading public grew, so fashion consciousness
increased, and magazines, wholly or partly devoted to fashions,
flourished and were widely read in the middle social classes; this
growth of fashion periodicals also is briefly described here.</i></p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Author</span>: <i>John L. Nevinson,
retired, was formerly with The Victoria and Albert Museum, London. He
now devotes himself to full-time research on costumes and their
history.</i></p>

</div>


<!-- png04 -->
<p><span class = "firstword"><span class = "dropcap">F</span>ashion may
be defined</span> as a general style of dress appropriate for a
particular person to wear at a certain time of day, on a special
occasion, or for a specific purpose.</p>

<p>A fashion plate is a costume portrait, that is to say, a portrait not
of an individual but one which shows the sort of clothes that are being
worn or that are likely to be worn. It is a generalized portrait,
indicating the style of clothes that a tailor, dressmaker, or store can
make or supply, or showing how different materials
<!-- png05 -->
can be made up into clothes. A&nbsp;fashion plate is related to the wear
of its epoch and not to the history of dress, except insofar as the
dress of a historical personage may be imitated at a later date.
A&nbsp;fashion plate is reproduced mechanically, the woodcuts and
engravings of earlier dates being succeeded by lithographs and finally
by the various photographic processes of our time.</p>

<p>This definition of a fashion plate is broader than the one adopted by
Mr. Vyvyan Holland, who has
<span class = "pagenum">68</span>
<!-- png06 -->
written the only substantial book on the subject.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag1" id = "tag1" href = "#note1">1</a> Mr. Holland limited his study
to hand-colored fashion plates of the period from 1770 to 1899, possibly
because these are most in favor with collectors. He omitted trade and
advertisement plates, believing them to be primarily concerned with the
history of dress.</p>

<p>The main functions of fashionable dress are to draw attention to the
wearer, to define his social position, and to show who he is and what he
is doing. Modesty, protection against the weather, and appeal to the
opposite sex, are, so far as fashion is concerned, subsidiary functions.
Interest in fashionable dress goes back at least to the 16th century, as
is evidenced by a popular dialogue written by Alessandro Piccolomini,
a&nbsp;relative of Pope Pius II, who subsequently became coadjutor
Archbishop of Siena.<a class = "tag" name = "tag2" id = "tag2" href =
"#note2">2</a> Piccolomini wrote under the pseudonym “Lo Stordito,” and
it is not clear to what extent the dialogue was sponsored by the Academy
of the <i>Intronati</i>, an aristocratic, literary, and social society
of which he was a member. He stated that the requirements of fashionable
dress were that it be sumptuous in material, tasteful in style, and
borne gracefully by the wearer. Unfortunately for the costume historian,
the dialogue is not illustrated.</p>

<p>It has been assumed too readily perhaps that the fashion plate dates
from the late 18th century, but it is not difficult to demonstrate that
it existed in all its essentials at earlier periods, even though its
history may not be continuous. The beginning of the illustration of
fashions is found in portraits, the earliest of which, either sculptured
or painted, developed from images of kings and important personages.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag3" id = "tag3" href = "#note3">3</a> These
images, unlike the <i>imagines</i> of the Romans, made no attempt to
portray the features of an individual, but made his identity known
rather by his clothes, his arms, and other indications of rank or
position. The development of the stylized image into the personal
portrait is well illustrated in the diary of Jörg von Ehingen.<a class =
"tag" name = "tag4" id = "tag4" href = "#note4">4</a> Von Ehingen, who
traveled widely in Europe during the years preceding 1460, might be
described as a professional jouster, who took part,
<!-- png07 -->
usually with great success, in tournaments at the various courts. To
illustrate the account of his exploits, he had portraits drawn and
painted of the different princes and kings, portraying each not with his
crown and scepter but with the distinctive fashion of his court. This
diary&mdash;not printed until the 19th century&mdash;was circulated in
manuscript and shows, in addition to the interest in personal portraits,
the growing interest in the dress of individuals.</p>

<p>Although the earlier painters of the Italian Renaissance recorded the
decorative and often exotic dress
<span class = "pagenum">69</span>
<!-- png08 -->
of their times, their portraits of individuals consisted in the main of
medallic heads and busts. It was the German portrait painters who, to a
greater extent, recorded and disseminated the knowledge of fashions.
Hans Burgkmair painted himself on the occasions of his betrothal in 1497
and his marriage in 1498,<a class = "tag" name = "tag5" id = "tag5" href
= "#note5">5</a> and in the 16th century Hans Holbein the younger noted
<!-- png09 -->
on his drawings the dress material and colors of the clothes worn by his
sitters.<a class = "tag" name = "tag6" id = "tag6" href = "#note6">6</a>
Even a much less distinguished person, Matthäus Schwartz, a&nbsp;clerk
employed by the banking firm of the Fuggers at Augsburg, had a book
prepared showing the clothes he wore at what he considered to be the
most important stages of his career.<a class = "tag" name = "tag7" id =

</div>

<p>The first person to have such pictures printed was Sigmund von
Herberstein, who deserves detailed consideration.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag8" id = "tag8" href = "#note8">8</a> In his diplomatic career, which
extended over 30 years, Sigmund von Herberstein served three
Emperors&mdash;Maximilian I, Charles V, and Ferdinand I. He was a
student of Russian history and an outstanding linguist, who, having
learned Wendish as a boy, found no difficulty with the Polish and
Russian languages. When, in his old age, he printed his memoirs, he
doubtlessly aimed at giving information on how an ambassador should
conduct himself and to this end included illustrations of what he
actually had worn, which in many copies of the memoirs are carefully
colored by hand.<a class = "tag" name = "tag9" id = "tag9" href =
"#note9">9</a> Concerning his journey in 1517 (<a name = "fig1_text" id
= "fig1_text" href = "#fig1">fig.&nbsp;1</a>), he states that “In these
robes I was sent on the embassy to Sigismund King of Poland,” no doubt
the fashion for the formal dress of an envoy. On his first embassy to
the Grand Duke of Moscow in 1517 he was presented with a Russian
fur-lined robe, but on his second embassy in 1526, he received a greater
distinction (fig.&nbsp;2): “Having been sent a second time by the
Emperor Ferdinand then Archduke to Moscow, the Grand Duke bestowed upon
me these robes.” This dress was far more sumptuous than the formal black
velvet gown which he normally wore for embassies to the Spanish and
other courts.</p>

are of similar fabric but with a dark violet ground for contrast. From
<i>Gratae Posteritati</i>, 1560. (<i>Courtesy of British Museum,

</div>

<p>By 1541 there was a change in fashion (fig.&nbsp;3). Von Herberstein
wrote: “We two orators were sent in this dress to the Turkish Emperor,”
and it was in this dress that von Herberstein, suffering perhaps from
arthritis, complained of having great difficulty
<span class = "pagenum">70</span>
<!-- png10 -->
in bowing low enough to kiss the hand of the seated Sultan. The imperial
fashion of breeches and hose might have seemed indelicate to Suleiman
“the Magnificant,” who gave the ambassadors other robes (fig.&nbsp;4):
“The Emperor of the Turks presented us also with these robes.” The
long-gowned costume shown here should have been completed by a turban,
but von Herberstein evidently would not allow himself to be depicted in
this.</p>

<p>Von Herberstein seems to have kept his robes in his palace in Vienna,
along with his collection of Russian and oriental weapons, illustrated
in his history of Russia:<a class = "tag" name = "tag10" id = "tag10"
href = "#note10">10</a> these, and stuffed specimens of Aurochs, then
almost extinct, and European bison, formed the first museum of costume
and natural history on record.</p>

<p>With the development of ceremonial, some of the princely courts of
Germany had illustrations prepared of what should be worn by the
officials of different grades (fig.&nbsp;5). Several copies of each of
these <i>Hofkleiderbücher</i>&mdash;books giving rules or standards for
correct court dress&mdash;were no doubt issued, but none seems to have
been printed for the general information of the public. The first
printed book on tailoring, by Juan de Alcega, was published in 1588 and
includes diagrams showing how to cut ceremonial robes from the roll of
cloth,<a class = "tag" name = "tag11" id = "tag11" href =

garments should look like.</p>

</div>

<p>The history of fashion plates, therefore, is to be followed in less
specialized works. In the 16th century, with the improvement of
communications and the continuation of voyages of discovery, great
interest developed in the costume and way of life of other nations. It
is in this connection that the word “fashion” was first used in its
modern sense. In an address to King Henry VIII, a&nbsp;petitioner in
1529, deploring the sinfulness of the people of England, wrote:<a class
= "tag" name = "tag12" id = "tag12" href = "#note12">12</a></p>

<blockquote>
The pryncypall cause [of sin] is their costly apparell and specially
their manyfolde and divers changes of fasshyons which the men and
specially the women must weare uppon both hedde and bodye: sometyme
cappe, sometyme hoode, now the French fasshyon now the Spanyshe fasshyon
and then the Italyan fasshyon and the Myllen [Milan] fasshyon, so that
there is noo ende of consuminge of substance&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
</blockquote>

<p>Foreign fashions were being imitated by English ladies. Inventories<a
class = "tag" name = "tag13" id = "tag13" href = "#note13">13</a> in the
Public Record Office in London show that the English queens had robes
cut in
<span class = "pagenum">71</span>
<!-- png13 -->
Spanish, Milanese, or French styles. As for men, it was said that they
could not make up their minds what to wear, and a popular caricature
shows an Englishman standing naked with a roll of cloth under his arm
and a pair of tailor’s shears in his hand, saying:<a class = "tag" name
= "tag14" id = "tag14" href = "#note14">14</a></p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>I am an English man, and naked I stand here,</p>

<p>For now I wyll were thys, and now I wyll were that;</p>
<p>Now I wyll were I cannot tel what.</p>
</div>

<p>London, however, was not a fashion center, and the first book on the
fashions of nations was printed in
<!-- png14 -->
Paris in 1562.<a class = "tag" name = "tag15" id = "tag15" href =
"#note15">15</a> In his introduction to the book François Deserpz
moralized:<a class = "tag" name = "tag16" id = "tag16" href =

<blockquote>

<p>Acknowledgments were made to the late Captain Roberval and to an
unnamed Portuguese, but it is not known which of them contributed the
portrait of the
<span class = "pagenum">72</span>

English lady (fig.&nbsp;6). Although she is said to be distinguishable
by her square bonnet, it is hard to find the style paralleled in any
other picture. The huge slashes on the bodice of her gown surely are
exaggerated, as is the smallness of the muff which hangs by a cord from
her waist. On the other hand, Joris Hoefnagel copied and used the
portrait as one of a group of citizens standing in the foreground of
Hogenberg’s 1574 plan of London,<a class = "tag" name = "tag17" id =

<p>Much more convincing as evidence of fashions are the etchings by

<p>The next development in the history of the fashion plate is found in
the costume books by Cesare Vecellio, published in Venice in 1590 and
1598.<a class = "tag" name = "tag20" id = "tag20" href =
"#note20">20</a> Vecellio, a
<!-- png18 -->
member of the same family as Titian, showed the costume of the different
ranks of society in the various Italian cities and states, in the other
countries of Europe, and indeed in the known world; he also depicted a
number of antique and old-fashioned dresses. Unfortunately, the
illustrations (fig.&nbsp;9) by Christoph Krieger, whose name was
Italianized as Guerra, are not as good as Vico’s, and Krieger died
before the series was complete. But Vecellio took great pains to secure
accurate and up-to-date information about fashions, and he received
letters and drawings from his friends in various cities of Italy. Master
Erasmo Falte of Parma sent him particulars of the
<span class = "pagenum">74</span>
<!-- png19 -->
dress of the Duchess of Parma, together with a sketch by a good local
painter, which Vecellio describes and adds:<a class = "tag" name =

<p>Thus, the bell-shaped farthingale (<a name = "fig8_text" id =
"fig8_text" href = "#fig8">fig.&nbsp;8</a>) had by 1590 become the
general wear of the upper classes in Italy, as it was already in Spain,
France, and England.</p>

<p>Of even greater interest is the evidence of Vecellio’s relations with
a fashion house in Venice. In his general account of the housedresses of
the noble ladies of his time, he mentions the rich modern materials and
especially silk brocades of four and even of six colors, admirably
woven:<a class = "tag" name = "tag22" id = "tag22" href =
"#note22">22*</a></p>

<blockquote>
Di queste opere si belle è stato in Venetia auttore M. Bartholomeo
Bontempele dal Calice, il quale alle volte con le mostre, ch’ egli fa di
questi drappi de’ quali lui è stato inventore, mostra la grandezza
dell’ingegno suo, la quale è accompagnata da una incomparabile
liberalità, e&nbsp;bontà, per ilche è molto amato dalla nobiltà
Venetiana, &amp; da molti Principi d’Italia &amp; in specie dal
Serenissimo Duca di Mantova. Nella sua buttiga dove molti Signori e
Principi mandano a fornirsi, &amp; fino al serraglio del Gran Turco, si
veggono broccati à opera di tutte le sorte d’oro e di argento.
</blockquote>

<p>It may seem strange that within 20 years of the Battle of Lepanto
(1571) Venetian fabrics were exported from Bontempele’s sign of “The
Chalice” to Constantinople to compete with the noted velvets of Brusa.
After describing the clothes of the best dressed merchants, Vecellio
does not hesitate to mention his
<!-- png20 -->
friends Master Paolo, spice merchant and vendor of the celebrated
<i>Theriakon</i> (known in England as Venice treacle), of the sign of
“The Ostrich,” and Bernadino Pillotto, seller of pictures and other
ornaments.</p>

Krieger. From <i>Varie acconciature di teste</i>, ca. 1590. (<i>Courtesy

</div>

<p>At this time there were also woodcuts illustrating hairstyles. The
exact date of Christoph Krieger’s <i>Varie Acconciature di Teste</i>
(fig.&nbsp;10) is not known. While Vecellio had remarked that the
Venetian ladies were imitating the goddess Diana and surmounting their
tresses with two little curls like horns, Krieger made illustrations
that were even more fanciful. Each lady bears the name of a city and a
distinguishing quality or temperament, but there is no more reason to
connect the styles with local fashions than to believe
<span class = "pagenum">76</span>
<!-- png22 -->
that the ladies of Ferrara were bold or those of Todi capricious.</p>

<p>Indeed, this series would not be considered in connection with
fashion plates were it not for a conversation in Ben Jonson’s
<i>Cynthia’s Revels</i>, first acted in 1600 by the Children of the
Queen’s Chapel. Philautia addresses her friend Phantaste (Act 2,
scene&nbsp;1):</p>

<div class = "drama">
<p>Philautia: . . . What, have you changed your head-tire?</p>

<p>Phantaste: Yes, faith, the other was near the common, it had no
extraordinary grace; besides, I&nbsp;had worn it almost a day, in good
troth.</p>

<p>Philautia: I’ll be sworn, this is most excellent for the device, and
rare; ’tis after the Italian print we looked on t’other night.</p>

<p>This certainly suggests that one of the little eyases, perhaps even
Nathaniel Field or Salathiel Pavy, was wearing a fantastic wig designed
after one of the Krieger woodcuts.</p>

<p>In the early 17th century there was nothing published in northern
Europe that was closely related to the fashion trade. There are
engravings of costume figures such as the <i>Sieben Edelleute
verschiedener Nation</i> by Willem Buytewech (Amsterdam, ca. 1614),
which are charmingly drawn but, as to costume, idealized and
exaggerated.<a class = "tag" name = "tag23" id = "tag23" href =
"#note23">23</a> The same criticism applies to the
<span class = "pagenum">77</span>
<!-- png23 -->
later series by J. de St. Igny, especially in <i>Le Jardin de la
Noblesse</i>, and to Jacques Callot’s <i>La Noblesse</i>,<a class =
"tag" name = "tag24" id = "tag24" href = "#note24">24</a> which depict
military and court dress with less caricature than most of this master’s
work. Among the engravings of Abraham Bosse, there is a series
(fig.&nbsp;11) relating to the sumptuary law of 1633 by which Louis
XIII, at the instigation of Cardinal Richelieu, tried to curb the
extravagance and simplify the dress of the ladies and gentlemen of his
court. This series is worth mentioning as a record of the dress at this
period, but neither these engravings nor the better known “Galerie du
Palais” (fig.&nbsp;12) are, strictly speaking, fashion plates which
provide information for dressmakers or wearers of clothes.<a class =

<p>In England, the engravings were of a rather different style. Dutch
prints of allegorical subjects were in vogue, and there are innumerable
sets of prints of the seven Ages of mankind, the five senses, the four
seasons, the continents, and the liberal arts, typified by real and
imaginary figures in all styles of dress. Jean Barrà’s figure “Seeing”
(fig.&nbsp;13), with her looking glass and perspective glass,
accompanied by the farsighted eagle, is illustrated here mainly because
of its explanatory quatrain mentioning fashions.<a class = "tag" name =

<p>Not until the early 1640s can reliable engravings of English fashions
be found. Most of Wenceslas Hollar’s 1639 series, “Ornatus Muliebris
Anglicanus, or, the severall habits of English women from the Nobilitie
to the Country woman, as they are in these times,” is slightly suspect
as being imaginary or at best idealized, though the lady in waiting
(Hollar’s no.&nbsp;23) and the country woman (Hollar’s no.&nbsp;26)
walking on her iron-ring pattens may be portraits. Hollar’s “Theatrum
Mulierum or Aula Veneris” of 1644 has a much stronger claim to represent
the fashions of London, although some of the European women may be in
the traditional clothes of their cities and states. The full-length
female figures of the seasons are really costume portraits set against
London backgrounds<a class = "tag" name = "tag27" id = "tag27" href =
"#note27">27</a> (fig.&nbsp;14), and, although charming
<!-- png24 -->
in themselves, they are not true fashion plates, while those of the
series of women’s heads in circles, which are not copied from other
work, are simply portraits<a class = "tag" name = "tag28" id = "tag28"
href = "#note28">28</a> of ladies whom Hollar actually knew in London.
Notwithstanding his engravings of muffs,<a class = "tag" name = "tag29"
id = "tag29" href = "#note29">29</a> it is most unlikely that Hollar had
any connection with either a fashion house or a milliner’s shop in
London.</p>

<p>During the Commonwealth period (1648-60) Hollar’s work depicting
costumes faded out, but the diarist John Evelyn was writing a little
book, <i>Tyrannus, or the Mode</i>, which was published in 1661.<a class
= "tag" name = "tag30" id = "tag30" href = "#note30">30</a> In it he
<span class = "pagenum">78</span>
<!-- png25 -->
mentions a French woman in London during the troubles, whose customers
tormented her with inquiries about French fashions to such an extent
that she used to devise “new Fancies out of her own Head, which were
never worn in France.” Most likely she did not distribute fashion plates
but displayed actual garments or miniature models, perhaps mounted as
dolls (“babies”), as examples of new fashions.</p>

<p>In the <i>Tyrannus</i>, Evelyn not only touched on the history and
psychology of fashion but also went as far as to recommend a reformed
dress for men, including the Persian vest and sash which was to be
reflected to
<!-- png26 -->
a certain extent in the fashions of the mid-1660s. Since he did not
illustrate his theory, there has always been some dispute as to what the
Persian dress actually was,<a class = "tag" name = "tag31" id = "tag31"
href = "#note31">31</a> but in any case the fashion did not last. On the
Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, Charles II, returning to England
from Holland, retained Dutch fashions for a while (fig.&nbsp;15). But,
by 1670, English men’s dress approximated the French in style, although
not in sumptuosity.</p>

<p>In the second half of the 17th century the attention of Europe was
focused on the court of Louis XIV and the French style of dress,
especially for men, predominated. In particular, the coat
(<i>justaucorps</i>), which evolved from the cassock, an outer garment,
began to be worn regularly over the doublet, which by this time was
already much reduced in size yet destined to survive as the waistcoat
(<i>veste</i>). This fashion spread fairly rapidly through
Europe&mdash;in England, as has been mentioned, it was dominant by
1670&mdash;but it is not clear how. The position of France, however, was
stated in a fashion article in the <i>Mercure Galant</i> in 1673
(vol.&nbsp;3):<a class = "tag" name = "tag32" id = "tag32" href =
"#note32">32*</a></p>

<blockquote>
. . . rien ne plait davantage que les Modes nées en France . . . . C’est
pourquoi dans toutes les Provinces du Monde on fait venir de France
quantité de choses qui regardent l’habillement encor qu’on ne s’habille
pas tout-a-fait à la Françoise&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
</blockquote>

<p>The <i>Mercure Galant</i>, strangely neglected by costume historians,
occupies a most important place in the history of fashion literature,
since it is the first and for almost a century the only periodical to
contain regular articles on contemporary fashion. The person responsible
for editing and indeed for writing these articles was Jean Donneau de
Visé (1640-1710), an unsuccessful dramatist, rival of Molière, whom he
sarcastically attacked several times in print. The story of his
journalistic venture is not at all easy to unravel,<a class = "tag" name
= "tag33" id = "tag33" href = "#note33">33</a>
<span class = "pagenum">79</span>
<!-- png28 -->
since the octavo publications (“Chez Claude Barbin, au Palais”) were
pirated almost immediately, and impressions&mdash;all that I have seen
are duodecimos&mdash;appeared in Paris and Amsterdam (“Suivant la Copie
imprimée à Paris”). A&nbsp;single number of an English translation, the
<i>Mercury Gallant</i>, is in the British Museum.</p>

<p>The <i>Mercure Galant</i> was published sporadically from 1672
through 1674, with six numbers in all. In 1677, it obtained a privilege
and, with a dedication to the Dauphin, took a new lease on life under
the title <i>Le nouveau Mercure Galant</i>. Thereafter, it flourished
for some years; the January-March number for 1677 was followed by
monthly parts, and on May 15, 1678, the first supplementary
(<i>Extraordinaire</i>) number was published, containing an article on
fashions illustrated
<!-- png29 -->
with fashion plates.<a class = "tag" name = "tag34" id = "tag34" href =
"#note34">34</a> The magazine was addressed to the ladies, and, in
addition to a modicum of news and war reports, it contained gossip,
poetry, riddles, songs with their music, and correspondence with
readers, some no doubt fictitious. It deserves full credit for being the
first modern-style magazine.</p>

took the opportunity to mention names wherever he could. The new fabrics
displayed below the shelves are distinguished by letters; the one on the
right (letter&nbsp;M), for example, is an Italian yellow satin brocaded
with white and violet. Other small figured fabrics, he wrote, might be
obtained away from the Palais “chez le Sieur Baroy, au Cloître Saint
Opportune,” and ribbons might be found from Sieur le Gras in the Palais
itself. The editor de Visé gives thanks to M.&nbsp;Bérain (1637-1711),

(1618-82) for engraving the plates.</p>

<p>The winter fashions for 1678-79 were described in a long article in
the ordinary October number of the <i>Mercure Galant</i>, which, for the
costume historian, is of great importance, since it deals among other
topics with the evasion of the sumptuary legislation by the fashionable
world. The fashion plates are by a new artist and are reduced to two

<p>From this point the <i>Mercure Galant</i> ceased to publish a regular
series of fashion plates. Occasional articles on fashion appeared
through the rest of the 1680s and into the next decade, but they are
shorter and less informative. Donneau de Vizé’s adventure into fashion
journalism evidently had failed, probably because of a lack of demand
for it. Fashions both in clothes and in fabrics did not change very
rapidly, and general fashion information was supplied by two
<span class = "pagenum">83</span>
<!-- png33 -->
other sources: first, by the annual almanacs, which were often
embellished by a large engraving of some important political event, and
secondly, by the print shops in the Rue St. Jacques and elsewhere, which
commissioned not only Lepautre, who had worked for the <i>Mercure
Galant</i>, but the Bonnarts, Jean de St. Jean, Arnoult, and other
competent artists to produce large engravings of contemporary
personalities. These for the most part depicted members of the French
royal family and court circle, actors and actresses, and other
well-known characters, not always named on the print. A&nbsp;“Man of
Quality” (fig.&nbsp;25) is almost certainly a portrait, which, when
suitably colored as many of the prints were, could
<!-- png34 -->
be pinned up or framed for decorative effect. It is wrong to take such a
print, as some writers on costume have done, for a fashion plate
recording what was worn or likely to be worn in the year in which it was
engraved.</p>

<p>In England, there was no fashion journalism or series of prints that
can be regarded as illustrations of late 17th-century fashion. Some use
can be made of the engravings after Marcellus Laroon, which were first
sold separately and later published in 1711 as the <i>Cryes of
London</i>,<a class = "tag" name = "tag36" id = "tag36" href =
"#note36">36</a> to illustrate costume in England, but neither these nor
the illustrations of English men and women which appear in general works
on the costume of Europe can be accepted as fashion plates. Other
series, such as the plates on the dress of Augsburg engraved by Jeremias
Wolff, belong more to
<!-- png36 -->
the history of costume than to the history of fashion.</p>

<p>In the early years of the 18th century, Bernard Picard, best known
for his great illustrated work on the religions of the world, made a few
small and very neat engravings of fashionable ladies, which were
published in Amsterdam in the 1720s. These engravings, some dated 1703,
should not be classed as fashion plates; like the Le Clerc engraving of
the man in rhinegrave breeches (<a name = "fig15_text" id = "fig15_text"
href = "#fig15">fig.&nbsp;15</a>), they are from drawing books. Some of
them, part reengraved by G.&nbsp;Bickham, Jr., were reissued in London
after 1732.<a class = "tag" name = "tag37" id = "tag37" href =
"#note37">37</a></p>

<p>In Paris there was a revival of the fashion plate in the late 1720s.
The still-existing <i>Mercure de France</i>, direct successor of the
<i>Mercure Galant</i>, carried an occasional fashion article with
engravings of dress accessories. In March 1729 (fig.&nbsp;27), there is
a not-very-well-defined sketch of a lady with her page, meeting a
gentleman. The accompanying paragraphs are not valuable but contain a
recommendation for “garnitures” to be had from La Demoiselle Perronet,
in the Cour Abbatial of St. Germain des Pres. As for “coeffures et têtes
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. on les coeffe sur une poupée.”</p>

</div>

<p>In the same year, 1729, a set of eight fashion plates entitled
<i>Recueil des Differentes Modes du Temps</i> was issued by Herisset
apparently to advertise a modiste called Chéreau at the “Grand St. Remy”
in the Rue St. Jacques. They are carefully drawn and show back and front
views as well as indicating materials (fig.&nbsp;28). No accompanying
text has been found, but as they are known in two versions, one said to
have been printed in Germany, it is likely that some descriptions were
prepared for the export market.<a class = "tag" name = "tag38" id =

</div>

<p>The French engravers working in England&mdash;Gravelot, Grignon, and
Boitard&mdash;produced some dated portraits of English ladies which can
be used as fashion illustrations. The caricature scenes, “Taste à la
Mode, 1735” and “Taste à la Mode, 1745,” published by Robert Sayer in
1749,<a class = "tag" name = "tag39" id = "tag39" href =
"#note39">39</a> also may serve as records of fashion. There was,
however, no journal of fashion in England before the reign of George
III. Indeed, there seems to have been no publication or series of prints
to give guidance to the fashion trade in Europe in the mid-18th
century.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">87</span>
<!-- png39 -->
<p>Technical information together with some fashion plates was available
in the 1760s in various volumes of the French <i>Encyclopédie</i>. M. de
Garsault wrote the section on the art of the tailor (1769) as well as
sections on wigs and wigmaking. The engravings by Jean Le Gros
(fig.&nbsp;29) were of practical use to hairdressers; a&nbsp;similar
book of hairstyle by James Stewart was published in England.<a class =

<p>The single-sheet almanac decorated with engravings of contemporary
events continued to be published in France in the 18th century,<a class
= "tag" name = "tag41" id = "tag41" href = "#note41">41</a> but pictures
in the English university almanacs were mainly topographical or
historical. The next development was the issue of annual memorandum
books or pocket diaries, which sometimes had a fashion plate as a
frontispiece. For example, the <i>Ladies Museum or Pocket Memorandum
Book</i>, 1774, contained an engraving of a “Lady in the most
fashionable dress of the year 1773.” This appeared not very long after
the first production of Oliver Goldsmith’s comedy <i>She Stoops to
Conquer</i>, which contains the following dialogue (Act&nbsp;2):</p>

<div class = "drama">
<p>Mrs. Hardcastle: Pray, how do you like this head, Mr. Hastings?</p>

<p>Mr. Hastings: Extremely elegant and degagée, upon my word, Madam.
Your friseur is a Frenchman, I&nbsp;suppose?</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardcastle: I protest, I dressed it from a print in the ladies
memorandum-book for the last year.</p>
</div>

<p><i>She Stoops to Conquer</i> was written in 1772-73, and, although a
memorandum book published at this date and containing fashion plates of
headdresses has not been traced, it is very likely that one existed.</p>

<p>But before this, in 1770, <i>The Lady’s Magazine or Entertaining
Companion for the Fair Sex</i> had begun its long career which lasted
until 1837. Figure 30 shows a typical fashion plate for 1774.
A&nbsp;lady in full court dress is talking to another in visiting dress;
behind, a&nbsp;third in full dress but without side hoops talks to a
friend in traveling dress with a calash hood; in the background a lady
in riding dress looks out of the window. Artistically such a fashion
plate is of no great distinction, but it served a purpose&mdash;to give
information about current fashions&mdash;very much better than the more
spectacularly illustrated productions such as Heideloff’s <i>Gallery of
Fashion</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>The 18th-century reading public became increasingly
<!-- png40 -->
fashion conscious, and there are several series of French colored
prints, the finest of them by Moreau le Jeune from 1775 onward, which
have high artistic merit and have been sought continuously by
collectors. Their purpose, however, was explicitly “pour servir à
l’histoire des Modes et du Costume des Français dans le XVIII<sup></sup>
siècle.” The prints are strongly romanticized and must be regarded as a
record of something between historical and fancy dress. The accompanying
text names but only briefly describes the dresses and then passes on to
facetious moralizing.</p>

<p>In the same way in London in 1794, Nicolaus Heideloff, whose
<i>Gallery of Fashion</i> was an imitation of one of the French series
by Esnaut and Rapilly entitled <i>La Gallerie des Modes</i>, though
claiming that the dresses he described were real ones, seems to have
<span class = "pagenum">88</span>
<!-- png41 -->
had as an objective the formation of a sort of picture gallery of
costume portraits of English ladies. Heideloff called it a Repository,
which is what we would call an archive today, but the term came to be
used by Rudolph Ackermann for his general magazine, <i>The Repository of
the Arts</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;, published between 1809 and 1828
(see p.&nbsp;89). The ladies in Heideloff’s aquatints are all different
in the sense that they are dressed differently and doing different
things, but the variations are mostly fanciful (fig.&nbsp;31). In fact,
the Heideloff prints served to fill picture books or to be pinned up or
framed on walls; they do not differ greatly in their approach from the
series of the Bonnarts and their contemporaries during the reign of
Louis XIV.</p>

<p>It is not proposed to give an account here of the
<!-- png42 -->
various magazines in the different countries which contained illustrated
articles on fashion from 1770 onward, since this would merely repeat
material in Mr. Vyvyan Holland’s book. Mention should be made, however,
of the movements for dress reform motivated either by economic
considerations or national feeling. Pamphlets and articles on these
subjects were usually without illustrations, except when concerned with
the revival or creation of a national costume.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag42" id = "tag42" href = "#note42">42</a> Sweden was the only country
where, thanks to the enthusiasm of King Gustavus III, the wearing of
national dress was more than an archaizing affectation. Dr. Eva
Bergman<a class = "tag" name = "tag43" id = "tag43" href =
"#note43">43</a> has described the origins of this Swedish national
dress in a book that
<span class = "pagenum">89</span>
<!-- png43 -->
is fully documented with tailors’ patterns and illustrations. As all
details were prescribed by court regulations and very little scope was
left for the impulses and personal choice of the wearers, the dress may
be regarded to a great extent as a uniform rather than a fashion.
Modifications did take place, however, and the style continued into the
19th century. As late as 1827, a&nbsp;pamphlet was published in
Copenhagen on the same subject.<a class = "tag" name = "tag44" id =
"tag44" href = "#note44">44</a></p>

<p>With these dress-reform books must also be included
<!-- png44 -->
the books on French Revolution fashions, of which that by Grasset de
Saint-Sauveur is the best known.<a class = "tag" name = "tag45" id =
"tag45" href = "#note45">45</a> When reading the descriptions of dress
of the various officials, grades, and classes, one wonders whether such
clothes were actually worn except on state occasions, or whether they
were fanciful novelties which the French officials in their reaction
against Louis XVI and his court thought would be appropriate for the new
regime. The intention of this book, however, undoubtedly was serious and
quite unlike the caricature
<span class = "pagenum">91</span>
<!-- png46 -->
fashion plates often titled “Merveilleuse” or “Incroyable,” which amused
everyone in the early years of the 19th century.</p>

<p>After 1800 many types of magazines flourished, and the increase in
the number of lending and subscription libraries and also of public
libraries fostered a new reading public. The magazines had illustrated
fashion articles. Often the engravings, and later the lithographs,
colored by hand, were their most attractive feature. Not that any great
originality was shown; the latest Paris fashions were often adapted,
with or without acknowledgment from French fashion plates of the
previous season. Men’s and children’s fashions were not adapted on
nearly the same scale. Possibly, men’s fashions were more static, or
confined to details such as variations in tying the cravat.<a class =

</div>

<p>Three magazines are worth special mention. <i>La Belle Assemblée, or
Bell’s Court and Fashionable Magazine</i> “addressed particularly to the
ladies” was published in London from 1806 to 1868 (fig.&nbsp;32). During
the 1820s the plates were of less merit, but there was a later
improvement. In 1809, the London print firm of Ackermann began to
publish <i>The Repository of Arts, Letters, Commerce</i> and
<i>Manufactures Fashion and Politics</i>. This magazine had a much wider
scope, and its illustrations are of good quality (fig.&nbsp;33).
A&nbsp;special feature was the inclusion of small sample squares of new
materials pasted into the text which named and described them. This
feature usefully supplements industrial records of the period, which are
hard to come by and difficult to handle in that those preserved are
usually bulky, not too well dated, and show no distinction between
fabrics made for export and those for the home market. Thirdly, from
1830 to 1898, <i>Godey’s Lady’s Book</i> was published in Philadelphia,
<!-- png47 -->
under titles which varied from time to time (<a name = "fig34_text" id =
"fig34_text" href = "#fig34">fig.&nbsp;34</a>). This magazine is much
more famous for its other contents than for its fashion articles; its
plates, often copied from French engravings, are of low quality and
rather crudely colored.</p>

<p>The number, variation, and wide distribution of 19th-century fashion
plates has proved something of a handicap to the historian in search of
reliable information about dress. Mr. Holland has studied them from the
artistic angle, tracing many of the French artists, who did not scorn
fashion work. The relation of fashion plates to Victorian dresses as
worn has been touched on by many costume writers,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag47" id = "tag47" href = "#note47">47</a> but the relation of the
fashion plate to the fashion house has yet to be studied; in particular,
the large sheets put out by wholesale drapers and textile manufacturers
and the advertisements of ready-made clothing that appear in magazines
all through the 19th century have not yet been studied to full
advantage.</p>

</div>

<p>This account of the fashion plate is necessarily incomplete, because
its history and development has not been continuous, and new links may
yet be found. The earlier period has been treated in greater detail
because it is generally less well-known, and the boundaries between the
fashion plate and the costume picture are not all easy to define. The
fashion plate has died slowly, the victim of the photograph showing the
model wearing actual clothes and the sketch giving the impression of a
fashion artist at a dress show. Through the centuries, the fashion plate
has provided the link between the wearer and the maker of clothes. It
has also attracted as collectors those studying both the social
background of a period and the history of costume.</p>
